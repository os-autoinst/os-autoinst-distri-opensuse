description:    >
  Create a 2 nodes cluster on ppc64le hmc_pvm backend for testing the priority fencing delay feature

  Schedule for priority fencing delay test cluster nodes.
  Use HA_CLUSTER_INIT setting in the job group so the schedule loads the tests for a node running ha-cluster-init or for nodes running ha-cluster-join.
  Some settings are defined here in the schedule, while others are required outside the schedule.

  The following settings must be defined outside of the schedule, either in the job group yaml configuration or in a test suite.

  CLUSTER_NAME - defining a name for the cluster test, for example qdevice. Only use characters permitted by DNS in this name
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT - set to yes on the node that does ha-cluster-init, and to no on the nodes that do ha-cluster-join
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN - set to the hostname of the node that runs ha-cluster-init
  HOSTNAME - set to the name of the node hostname
  NICTYPE - must be set to 'tap' in the job group directly in qemu based jobs.
  STONITH_COUNT - set the number of stonith test for validating the fencing priority feqture
  YAML_SCHEDULE - set to schedule/ha/bv/pvm_ha_priority_fencing.yaml

  All jobs with the exception of the HA_CLUSTER_JOIN=yes job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting referencing the HA_CLUSTER_INIT=yes job.

  CLUSTER_INFOS - must be set in one of the nodes instead of the support server.
  ISCSI_SERVER - must be set in all nodes.
  ISCSI_LUN_INDEX - must be set in all nodes, tells the modules which LUN in the iSCSI server to use to avoid having multiple jobs using the same devices.
  NFS_SUPPORT_SHARE - must be set in all nodes, a RW NFS share where the nodes will write file and share information.
