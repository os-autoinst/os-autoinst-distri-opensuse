  Create a 2 nodes cluster with qdevice/qnetd

  This schedule corresponds to the node that runs ha-cluster-init in a
  qdevice/qnetd cluster test. It must be scheduled PARALLEL_WITH a support
  server, as well as the other cluster nodes and the qnetd server. Some settings
  are defined here in the schedule, while others are required outside the
  schedule.

  The following settings must be defined outside of the schedule, either in
  the job group yaml configuration or in a test suite.

  CLUSTER_NAME defining a name for the cluster test, for example qdevice. Only
  use characters permitted by DNS in this name.
  HDD_1 pointing to a qcow2 image generated by created_hdd_ha_textmode
  NICTYPE set to tap in qemu tests
  PARALLEL_WITH pointing to the name of the support server job
  UEFI_PFLASH_VARS pointing to a qcow2 image with the UEFI vars generated
  by create_hdd_ha_textmode (if necessary)
  WORKER_CLASS
  YAML_SCHEDULE set to schedule/ha/bv/ha_qdevice_node1.yaml

  # Boot qcow2 image generated by create_hdd_ha_textmode
