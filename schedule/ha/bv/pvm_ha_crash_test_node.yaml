  HA Cluster Test on ppc64le hmc_pvm backend. Schedule for all nodes.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings are required in the job group.

  CLUSTER_NAME must be defined for all jobs as a string.
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT must be defined to yes in the job that initializes the cluster and to
  no in the the other cluster node jobs
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN must be defined for the rest of the jobs, and it must contain the
  hostname of the job where HA_CLUSTER_INIT is defined to yes
  HOSTNAME must be defined to different hostnames for each node.
  MAX_JOB_TIME is recommended to be defined as well to a high value (ex. 20000)
  All jobs with the exception of the HA_CLUSTER_INIT=yes job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the HA_CLUSTER_INIT=yes job.

  CLUSTER_INFOS must be set in one of the nodes instead of the support server.
  ISCSI_SERVER must be set in all nodes.
  ISCSI_LUN_INDEX - must be set in all nodes,
  tells the modules which LUN in the iSCSI server to use to avoid having multiple jobs using the same devices.
  NFS_SUPPORT_SHARE - must be set in all nodes, a RW NFS share where the nodes will write file and share information.

  SLE_PRODUCT must be defined and set accordingly.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
vars:
  DESKTOP: 'textmode'
  HA_CLUSTER: '1'
  HDD_SCC_REGISTERED: '1'
  # Below setting must be defined in the openQA UI because macros for %VERSION%,
  # %ARCH% and %BUILD% are usually not defined yet when this file is being loaded
  # HDD_1: SLE-%VERSION%-%ARCH%-Build%BUILD%-sles4sap-gnome.qcow2
