  HA Pacemaker Cluster Test Suite - Single Machine Regression Test.

  Schedule to test Pacemaker Cluster Test Suite in a single machine
  job for the purpose of identifying regressions in pacemaker and
  pacemaker-cts.

  Most settings required by this test are defined below, but the
  following extra settings must be provided via CLI, YAML job
  group configuration or test suites.

  HDD_1 must be defined to the path of the qcow2 image to use as SUT's
  disk/boot device.
  Similarly, if using UEFI boot, set UEFI_PFLASH_VARS to the patch of the
  UEFI vars qcow2 image.
  Finally, add any scheduler related settings such as START_AFTER_TEST
  or PARALLEL_WITH.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
