  HA Pacemaker Cluster Test Suite.

  This test sets up a cluster and run a wide variety of complex tests.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_NAME must be defined for all jobs as a string.
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT must be defined to yes in the job where the cluster is initialized,
  and to no in the rest of the cluster node jobs
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN must be defined for the rest of the jobs, and it must contain the
  hostname of the job where HA_CLUSTER_INIT is defined to yes
  HOSTNAME must be defined to different hostnames for each node.
  MAX_JOB_TIME is recommended to be defined as well to a high value (ex. 20000)
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  NICTYPE and WORKER_CLASS must be set to 'tap' in the job group directly in qemu based jobs.
  SLE_PRODUCT must be defined and set accordingly.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
