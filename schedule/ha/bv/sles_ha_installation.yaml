  Install SLES+HA.

  In order to generate a qcow2 image with this schedule so it can be used by other tests,
  add the settings CREATE_HDD and set it to 1 and PUBLISH_HDD_1 and set it to the name
  of the qcow2 image to save; add these settings either in the job group configuration,
  test suite or command line. Also add PUBLISH_PFLASH_VARS on uefi scenarios.

  Add an SCC_REGISTER setting via job group configuration, command line or testsuite and
  set it to 'installation' so the SUT is registered to SCC, or set it to 'never' to skip
  registration. If setting it to 'never', also add an ADDONS setting defined to 'ha' so
  the HA extension is added during installation. The corresponding setting for SCC (SCC_ADDONS)
  is not needed as its defined in this schedule.

  Also set SYSTEM_ROLE to default, minimal or textmode depending on the test; do not leave it
  out as schedule can be used with either of the three values, but if default is not explicitly
  set, test will chose textmode system role as DESKTOP is set to textmode in the schedule.

  Below are optional settings.

  Set CHECK_ISO_MAXSIZE to 1 to schedule the installation/isosize test module to check the ISO
  size against the ISO_MAXSIZE setting. It is recommended to not schedule this module when
  ISO_MAXSIZE is not defined in the medium.
  Set CHECK_PRESELECTED_MODULES to true to verify pre-selected modules during registration
  Set CHECK_RELEASENOTES to 1 to check release notes during installation
  Use HDDMODEL to set the type of HDD, either virtio-blk, scsi-hd, etc.
  Set VIDEOMODE to text to perform text-based installation.
