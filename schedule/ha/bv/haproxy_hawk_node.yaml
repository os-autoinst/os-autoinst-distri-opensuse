  HA haproxy and hawk cluster tests.

  This test makes a two nodes cluster and a client machine for testing the
  hawk (High Availability Web Console) features.
  From the client machine side, the selenium framework is used to check that
  all the functionality behaves well.

  Then, we do a simple test of the haproxy Resource Agent. We make sure that the RA
  is configurable in the cluster configuration. Finally, we check if the round-robin
  mode is doing its job by requesting a virtual ip.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_NAME must be defined for all jobs as a string.
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT must be defined to yes on the job that initializes the cluster, and to
  no on the rest of the cluster node jobs
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN must be defined for the rest of the jobs, and it must contain the
  hostname of the job where HA_CLUSTER_INIT is defined to yes
  HOSTNAME must be defined to different hostnames for each node.
  MAX_JOB_TIME is recommended to be defined as well to a high value (ex. 20000)
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  NICTYPE and WORKER_CLASS must be set to 'tap' in the job group directly in qemu based jobs.
  SLE_PRODUCT must be defined and set accordingly.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
