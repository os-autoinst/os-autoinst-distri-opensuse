  SupportServer definition for HA tests.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_INFOS must be defined in the parent job to the name of the cluster, number
  of nodes and number of LUNs. Example 'hana:2:3'
  NUMDISKS must be defined and set to the total number of disks, usually 2 for a
  iSCSI server.
  HDDMODEL may be defined to scsi-hd, otherwise its default setting will be used
  HDDSIZEGB_2 must be defined and set to the needed size of the 2nd disk.
  NUMLUNS must be defined and set to the needed number of LUNs.
  MAX_JOB_TIME is recommended to be defined as well to a high value (ex. 20000).
  NICTYPE and WORKER_CLASS must be set to 'tap' in the job group directly in qemu based jobs.
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
