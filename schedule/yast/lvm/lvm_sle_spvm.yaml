  Conduct installation with LVM selected during installation using guided setup.
  For spvm we have to disable plymouth, so edit_optional_kernel_cmd_parameters
  module is scheduled and OPT_KERNEL_PARAMS variable is set. Also, as of now
  spvm backend doesn't support x11 tests, hence use textmode. In comparison to
  SLE 12 we register the installation and have system roles wizard screen.
