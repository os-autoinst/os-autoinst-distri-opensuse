  Conduct installation with encrypted LVM selected during installation. Generated
  disk image used in downstream jobs. (crypt-)LVM installations can take longer,
  especially on non-x86_64 architectures. For spvm we have to disable plymouth,
  so edit_optional_kernel_cmd_parameters module is scheduled and OPT_KERNEL_PARAMS
  variable is set. In comparison to SLE 12 we register the installation and have
  system roles wizard screen.
