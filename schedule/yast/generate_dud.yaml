  Generate DUD dynamically:
  - (1) Boot an image where module phub can be added successfully
        (repo is consolidated for the product) allowing to install mkdud
        (from a product not under development).
  - (2) Create DUD expanding variables using values configured for the product.
  - (3) Upload the DUD as an asset to be used by a chained job.
