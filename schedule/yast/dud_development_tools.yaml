description: >
  Same as dud_sdk, but due to bsc#1080292 we cannot use ISO.  FTP url is used
  instead. Limitation is that we use x86_64 url, as cannot create DUD in the
  runtime, so test cannot be executed on other architectures.
  Also development tools module requires desktop applications module as a
  dependency, so DESKTOP is set to gnome.
vars:
  DUD: dev_tools.dud
  DUD_ADDONS: sdk
  DESKTOP: gnome
