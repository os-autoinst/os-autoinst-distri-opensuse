description:    >
  Test AutoYaST installation when graphical target is specified as default in
  AutoYaST control file, but the system does not have graphical environment
  installed.
  Covered cases:
     - Verify that graphical target is set as default even if there is no
       graphical environment installed. When there are no graphical components
       installed, graphical.target is equal to multi-user.target;
     - Verify that the system loads and don't hang after installation. This is
       done indirectly by logging in to the system after installation.
