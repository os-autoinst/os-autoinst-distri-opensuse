  Conduct installation activating encrypted partitions, but creating encrypted
  lvm setup from scratch. Using pre-partitioned disk image to validate encrypted
  partitions activation and that we can re-ecnrypt the disk.
  For powerVM we have to disable plymouth, so edit_optional_kernel_cmd_parameters
  module is scheduled and OPT_KERNEL_PARAMS variable is set.
