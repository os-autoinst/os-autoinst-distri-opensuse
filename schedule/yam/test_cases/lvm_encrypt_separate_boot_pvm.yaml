  Same as lvm-full-encrypt, but with separate boot not encrypted partition, only
  installation to not repeat everything again with small risk.
  For powerVM we have to disable plymouth, so edit_optional_kernel_cmd_parameters
  module is scheduled and OPT_KERNEL_PARAMS variable is set.
  Also, we don't test gnome on powerVM, so set Desktop to textmode.
vars:
  DESKTOP: textmode
  UNENCRYPTED_BOOT: 1
  ENCRYPT: 1
  FULL_LVM_ENCRYPT: 1
  YUI_REST_API: 1
