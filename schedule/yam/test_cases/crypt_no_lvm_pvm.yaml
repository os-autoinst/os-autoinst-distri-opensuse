description: >
  Test installation with encrypted partitions but without lvm enabled.
  This is supported only by storage-ng, hence, do NOT enable test suite on
  distris without storage-ng.
  For spvm we have to disable plymouth, so edit_optional_kernel_cmd_parameters
  module is scheduled and OPT_KERNEL_PARAMS variable is set.
  In comparison to SLE 12 we register the installation and have system roles
  wizard screen.
