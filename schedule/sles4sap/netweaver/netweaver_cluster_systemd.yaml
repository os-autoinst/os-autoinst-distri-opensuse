  NetWeaver Cluster Test (with switch to systemd). Schedule for all nodes.

  This test just adds the patching (needed as long as NW does not come with systemd
  support without patching) and the systemd registration before doing the cluster test.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_INFOS must be defined in the parent job to the name of the cluster, number
  of nodes and number of LUNs. Example 'nw:2:3'
  CLUSTER_NAME must be defined for all jobs as a string.
  INSTANCE_ID, INSTANCE_IP_CIDR, INSTANCE_SID and INSTANCE_TYPE must be defined and set
  according to NE needs.
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT must be defined to yes on the job that initializes the cluster, and to
  no in the rest of the cluster node jobs
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN must be defined for the rest of the jobs, and it must contain the
  hostname of the job where HA_CLUSTER_INIT is defined to yes
  NW must be defined pointing to the location of the NW installation masters
  HOSTNAME must be defined to different hostnames for each node.
  MAX_JOB_TIME is recommended to be defined as well to a high value (ex. 20000)
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  SLE_PRODUCT must be defined and set to sles4sap.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
