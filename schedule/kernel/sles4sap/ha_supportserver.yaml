  SupportServer definition for HA tests.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_INFOS must be defined in the parent job to the name of the cluster, number
  of nodes and number of LUNs. Example 'hana:2:3'
  NUMDISKS must be defined and set to the total number of disks, usually 2 for a
  iSCSI server.
  HDDSIZEGB_2 must be defined and set to the needed size of the 2nd disk.
  NUMLUNS must be defined and set to the needed number of LUNs.
  MAX_JOB_TIME is recommended to be defined as well to a high value (ex. 20000).
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  SLE_PRODUCT must be defined and set to sles4sap.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
