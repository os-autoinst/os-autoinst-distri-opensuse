=head1 SYNOPSIS

This library contains various functions that help finding and connecting openQA job to the correct deployment VM.
Deployment VM is recognized from other VMs by being tagged with B<deployment_id> tag. Deployment ID is an unique
identifier which is an OpenQA job ID of a job that created this VM.
In single machine test Deployment ID equals test ID. This is not always true in case of multi-machine jobs.
Deployment ID might be an ID of the parent job which executed the deployment itself.

B<Example>:
Job: 123456 - deployment module - created deployer VM tagged with "deployment_id=123456",
Job: 123457 (child of 123456) - some test module
Deployment ID returned from both jobs: 123456 - because it matches with existing VM tagged with "deployment_id=123456"

=head2 check_ssh_availability

    check_ssh_availability($deployer_ip_addr [, ssh_port=>42 ,$wait_started=>'true', wait_timeout=>'42']);

Checks if deployer VM is running and listening on ssh port. Returns found state.
Optionally function can wait till VM reaches requested state until timeout.
Function dies only with internal errors, VM status should be evaluated and handled by caller.

Returns deployer VM name which is tagged with B<deployment_id> specified in parameter. This means that the VM was used
to deploy the infrastructure under this ID and contains whole SDAF setup.
Function returns VM name or undef if no VM was found.
Function dies if there is more than one VM found, because two VM's must not have same ID.

=head2 find_deployment_id

    find_deployment_id(deployer_resource_group=>$deployer_resource_group);

Finds deployment ID for currently running test. Deployment ID is ID of an OpenQA test which created deployer VM.
In case of multi-machine test this can be either parent test ID or current job id as well.
This function collects all OpenQA job IDs related to current test run and checks if any of them match an existing
deployer VM tagged with this ID.

Using OpenQA parameter B<SDAF_DEPLOYMENT_ID> it is possible to override this value. It is mostly intended for development
purposes where it allows you to run test code on already existing deployment. Use it with caution and override
the value only with ID of the infrastructure that belongs to you.

B<Example>:
Job: 123456 - deployment module - created deployer VM tagged with "deployment_id=123456",
Job: 123457 (child of 123456) - some test module
Deployment ID returned from both jobs: 123456 - because it matches with existing VM tagged with "deployment_id=123456"

=head2 destroy_orphaned_deployers

    destroy_orphaned_deployers([timeout=>9999]);

Destroys orphaned deployer VM resources existing inside permanent deployer resource group.
Function lists all resources and their creation time belonging to deployer RG which are tagged with 'deployment_id'.
Resource being tagged with 'deployment_id' means it was created by an OpenQA test.
Resource names are as well checked against OpenQA naming convention as another prevention from unwanted resource deletion.
Resources older than 'SDAF_DEPLOYER_VM_RETENTION_SEC' seconds (Default 7H) are considered as orphans and deleted.
Be very careful with changes here (especially with regexes and az cli filters) as mistakes can lead to damage on
permanent SDAF infrastructure.
