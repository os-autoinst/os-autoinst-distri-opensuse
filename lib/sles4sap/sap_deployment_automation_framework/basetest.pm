=head1 SYNOPSIS

Basetest for SDAF deployment. It includes full cleanup routine and post_fail hook.
Post run hook is not necessary as cleanup should not be triggered at the end of each test module.

=cut

=head2 full_cleanup

    full_cleanup();

Function performs full SDAF cleanup. First, it checks which stages of deployment are applied to avoid executing
unnecessary cleanup commands. Cleanup is done in following order:

=over

=item * executes SDAF remover script - destroys existing sap-systems and workload zone deployments

=item * destroys deployer VM and related resources like OS disk, NIC, Security group, etc.

=item *  keeps control plane intact (Control plane must not be deleted)
