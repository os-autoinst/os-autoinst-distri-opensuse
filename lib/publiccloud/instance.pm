=head2 run_ssh_command

    run_ssh_command(cmd => 'command', timeout => 90);

Runs a command C<cmd> via ssh in the given VM. Retrieves the output.
If the command retrieves not zero, a exception is thrown..
Timeout can be set by C<timeout> or 90 sec by default.
TODO Do not raise exception on error
TODO Be aware of special shell letters like ';'

=head2 scp

    scp($from, $to, timeout => 90);

Use scp to copy a file from or to this instance. A url starting with
C<remote:> is replaces with the IP from this instance. E.g. a call to copy
the file I</var/log/cloudregister> to I</tmp> looks like:
C<<<$instance->scp('remote:/var/log/cloudregister', '/tmp');>>>

    return script_run($ssh_cmd, $args{timeout});
}

=head2 upload_log

    upload_log($filename);

Upload a file from this instance to openqa using L<upload_logs()>.
If the file doesn't exists on the instance, B<no> error is thrown.
