# Summary: Host (hypervisor) where the test VMs will be spawned
#
# Maintainer: Jose Lausuch <jalausuch@suse.de>
#   Pre-requirements: - public ssh key in data dir must be set previously on the
#                       host to run SSH commands on the host without password
#                     - libvirt service must be running

    run_ssh_command($cmd);

    Runs a command C<cmd> via ssh on the Host. Retrieves the output.
    If the command retrieves not zero, an exception is thrown.

=head2 check_host

    check_host();

    Perform some checks on the host to see if it can run the tests
