# All configuration options related to a particular VM instance are defined as
# lists and prefixed with `GUEST_` label. It is essential, that there is enough
# items in all `GUEST_` options to cover all VM instances involved in the test.
# In case there is not enough items, then VSPERF will use the first item of
# particular `GUEST_` option to expand the list to required length. First option
# can contain macros starting with `#` to generate VM specific values. These
# macros can be used only for options of `list` or `str` types with `GUEST_`
# prefix.
# Following macros are supported:
#
# * #VMINDEX - it is replaced by index of VM being executed; This macro is
#   expanded first, so it can be used inside other macros.
#
# * #MAC(mac_address[, step]) - it will iterate given `mac_address` with
#   optional `step`. In case that step is not defined, then it is set to 1.
#   It means, that first VM will use the value of `mac_address`, second VM
#   value of `mac_address` increased by `step`, etc.
#
# * #IP(ip_address[, step]) - it will iterate given `ip_address` with optional
#   step. In case that step is not defined, then it is set to 1.
#   It means, that first VM will use the value of `ip_address`, second VM
#   value of `ip_address` increased by `step`, etc.
#
# * #EVAL(expression) - it will evaluate given `expression` as python code;
#   Only simple expressions should be used. Call of the functions is not
#   supported.
