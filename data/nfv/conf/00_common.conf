# Dictionary PATHS is used for configuration of vswitches, dpdk and qemu.
# It contains paths to various utilities, temporary directories and kernel
# modules used by VSPERF. Particular sections of PATHS dictionary are spread
# among several configuration files, i.e.:
# conf/02_vswtich.conf - configuration of vswitches (i.e. PATHS['vswitch'])
#                        and dpdk (i.e. PATHS['dpdk']) can be found there
# conf/04_vnf.conf     - configuration of qemu (i.e. PATHS['qemu']) can
#                        be found there
#
# VSPERF will process PATHS dictionary before execution of every testcase
# and it will create a testcase specific dictionary TOOLS with paths to the
# utilities used by the test. During PATHS processing, following rules
# will apply for every item of PATHS dictionary:
#     item 'type' - string, which defines the type of paths ('src' or 'bin') to be selected
#           for a given section:
#               'src' means, that VSPERF will use OVS, DPDK or QEMU built from sources
#                   e.g. by execution of systems/build_base_machine.sh script during VSPERF
#                   installation
#               'bin' means, that VSPERF will use OVS, DPDK or QEMU binaries installed
#                   in the OS, e.g. via OS specific packaging system
#     item 'path' - string with valid path; Its content is checked for existence, prefixed
#           with section name and stored into TOOLS for later use
#           e.g. TOOLS['dpdk_src'] or TOOLS['vswitch_src']
#     item 'modules' - list of strings; Every value from given list is checked for '.ko'
#           suffix. In case it matches and it is not an absolute path to the module, then
#           module name is prefixed with 'path' defined for the same section
#           e.g. TOOLS['vswitch_modules'] = [
#               '/tmp/vsperf/src_vanilla/ovs/ovs/datapath/linux/openvswitch.ko']
#     all other items - string - if given string is a relative path and item 'path'
#           is defined for a given section, then item content will be prefixed with
#           content of the 'path'. Otherwise tool name will be searched within
#           standard system directories. Also any OS filename wildcards will be
#           expanded to the real path. At the end of processing, every absolute
#           path is checked for its existence. In case that temporary path (i.e. path
#           with '_tmp' suffix) doesn't exist, then log will be written and vsperf will
#           continue. If any other path will not exist, then vsperf execution will
#           be terminated with runtime error.
#
# Note: In case that 'bin' type is set for DPDK, then TOOLS['dpdk_src'] will be set to
# the value of PATHS['dpdk']['src']['path']. The reason is, that VSPERF uses downloaded
# DPDK sources to copy DPDK and testpmd into the GUEST, where testpmd is built. In case,
# that DPDK sources are not available, then vsperf will continue with test execution,
# but testpmd can't be used as a guest loopback. This is useful in case, that other guest
# loopback applications (e.g. buildin) are used by CI jobs, etc.
