# wpa_supplicant test for openQA

Tests the functionality of `wpa_supplicant` by creating a virtual wifi network using the [mac80211_hwsim](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/mac80211_hwsim) kernel module and network namespace separation.

This archive works also as a standalone test for ``wpa_supplicant`

## Usage

    Usage:
    ./wpa_supplicant_test.sh

If the test terminates with the following lines, you're good

    [...]

The last line says, everything went fine.
