### How to get started

It can be beneficial to learn how an openQA job is executed. To setup your own
openQA instance, please refer to the documentation of the [openQA project](https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA).

Please, find up-to-date documentation references on the official [openQA project web-page](https://open.qa/documentation/).

If you are looking for a task to start with, check out the [openQA Tests](https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqatests/issues/)
Redmine project. Look for tickets with [easy] or [easy-hack] tags.

#### Relevant documentation

* All openQA documentation in a single [html page](https://open.qa/docs/)
* openQA [test api](http://open.qa/api/testapi/) documentation
* (wip) Available test library documentation http://os-autoinst.github.io/openQA/

### Reporting an issue

As mentioned above, we use Redmine as issue tracking tool. In case you found some
problem with the tests, please do not hesitate report [a new issue](https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqatests/issues/new)
Please, refer to the [template](https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3/wiki/#Defects).

If in doubt, contact us, we will be happy to support you.

### Coding style

The project follows the rules of the parent project
[os-autoinst](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst#how-to-contribute).
and additionally the following rules:

* Take [example boot.pm](https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-example/blob/master/tests/boot.pm)
  as a template for new files
* The test code should use simple perl statements, not overly hacky
  approaches, to encourage contributions by newcomers and test writers which
  are not programmers or perl experts
* Update the copyright information with the current year and *SUSE LLC* as the
  legal entity. For new files make sure to only state the year during which
  the code was written.
* Use `my ($self) = @_;` for parameter parsing in methods when accessing the
  `$self` object. Do not parse any parameter if you do not need any.
* [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)

### Preparing a new Pull Request
* All code needs to be tidy, for this use `make prepare` the first time you
  set up your local environment, use `make tidy` or `tools/tidy` locally to
  ensure your new code adheres to our coding style.
* Every pull request is tested by the travis CI for different perl versions,
  if something fails, run `make test` (don't forget to `make prepare` if your setup is new)
  but the travis results are available too, in case they need to be investigated further
* Whenever possible, [provide a verification run][1] of a job that runs the code [provided in the pull request][2]

Also see the [DoD/DoR][2] as a helpful (but not mandatory) guideline for new contributions.
