# Package: gnome-control-center vino systemd
# Summary: Test if the Screen Sharing GNOME Desktop functionality works
#   We currently need to install vino package for that
# - Launch "gnome-control-center sharing"
# - Enable sharing function
# - Install vino if necessary
#   - Relogin in case of install is necessary
#   - Redo screensharing enabling steps
# - Check if wayland is being used
#   - If wayland is detected, record_soft_failure (boo#1137569)
# - Finish with ctrl-q
# Maintainer: Pavel Dost√°l <pdostal@suse.cz>
