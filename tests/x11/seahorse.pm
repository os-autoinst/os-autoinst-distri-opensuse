# Summary: Test seahorse (GNOME Keyring frontend)
#    * As a side effect, it initializes the keyring so that other
#      tests running later can access an existing keyring (e.g. chromium &
#      chrome). This allows us not having to handle special cases there for
#      creating new keyring databases (Which, potentially, every application
#      could be asking for).
