# Summary: HPC master - backup master node
#    This test is aiming at comprehensive HPC testing. That means
#    that most components of the HPC product should be installed and
#    configured. At the same time it is expected that the HPC cluster
#    set-up is fairly complex, so that NFS shares are mounted, required
#    database(s) are ready to be used, artificial users are added etc.
# Maintainer: Sebastian Chlad <sebastian.chlad@suse.com>
