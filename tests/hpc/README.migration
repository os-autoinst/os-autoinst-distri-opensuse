HPC Migration

The tests rely on the fact that openQA fixed directory contains ready
qcow2 images. Those should be registered against SCC for base products,
as well as relevant parts: HPC and Web & Scripting.

The overall idea is to run some functional tests on system before the
actual migration. Then the system should be patched and eventually
migrated.

Upon successful migration the HPC cluster of VMs should be re-booted,
and all sanity checks should be performed, so that one can check if
all relevant parts of the HPC cluster still work as expected.

The overall concept differes from exisiting migration tests, as instead
of using openQA modules with run() functions, the tests are calling
relevant functions which take care of migration logic.
This approach allows for creating barriers without complicating exisiting
openQA migration modules.

MIGRATION_A - single machine tests checking basics
-- checking for correct migration targets
