HPC Migration

The tests rely on the fact that openQA fixed directory contains ready
qcow2 images. Those should be registered against SCC for base products,
as well as relevant parts: HPC and Web & Scripting. For multimachine set-up
there should be separate qcow2 registered.

The overall idea is to run some functional tests on system before the
actual migration. Then the system should be patched and eventually
migrated.

Upon successful migration the HPC cluster of VMs should be re-booted,
and all sanity checks should be performed, so that one can check if
all relevant parts of the HPC cluster still work as expected.

The overall concept differs from existing migration tests, as instead
of using openQA modules with run() functions, the tests are calling
relevant functions which take care of migration logic.
This approach allows for creating barriers without complicating existing
openQA migration modules.

Test organization
-----------------

MIGRATION_A - single machine tests checking basics
-- checking for both supported arches
-- checking for zypper online (next: yast and offline migrations)
-- checking for correct migration targets
-- basic migration of a single machine

MIGRATION_B - cluster tests checking HPC functionality upon migration
-- focused on zypper online migration as relevant for multimachine set-ups
-- starting the cluster on older SP
-- conducting HPC functional tests
-- running online zypper migration
-- restarting the cluster
-- conducting HPC functional tests
