# Summary: Add test for live installer based on Kde-Live
#  The live installer was missing for some time from the media and the left overs
#  in tests showed to be out of date. Changing all necessary references to ensure
#  the live medium can be booted, the net installer can be run from the plasma
#  session and the installed Tumbleweed system boots correctly. In the process an
#  issue with the live installer has been found and is worked around while
#  recording a reference to the bug.
