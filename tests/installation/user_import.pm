# G-Summary: Use existing encrypted volume and import users
#    When ENCRYPT_ACTIVATE_EXISTING is set, check that the existing volumes
#    have been detected and included in the default partitioning volume. If
#    not, issue soft failure bsc#989750 and rerun partition proposal without asserting
#    for new password prompts.
#
#    Added IMPORT_USER_DATA which when set, user_import.pm is loaded to
#    import old users rather than configure new ones.
# G-Maintainer: Richard Palethorpe <rpalethorpe@suse.com>
