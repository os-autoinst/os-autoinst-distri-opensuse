#                TEST DESCRIPTION:
#  this test test the read-only snapshot, from console. (1)
#  we print some console output only for nice debugging (1b)
#  if variable UPGRADE is set, we want to check that the 2 snapshots
#  before_upgrade and after upgrade are not identical. test is made
#  by checking the /etc/os-release, this is compatible also for openSUSE-TW (2)

# G-Summary: Add new test boot_into_snapshot
#    Main for opensuse changed. boot_into_snapshot test ronly snapshot
#    Test needed for testing the snapper rollback functionality.
# G-Maintainer: dmaiocchi <dmaiocchi@suse.com>
