# G-Summary: Add test for live installer based on Kde-Live
#    The live installer was missing for some time from the media and the left overs
#    in tests showed to be out of date. Changing all necessary references to ensure
#    the live medium can be booted, the net installer can be run from the plasma
#    session and the installed Tumbleweed system boots correctly. In the process an
#    issue with the live installer has been found and is worked around while
#    recording a reference to the bug.
#
#    Adds new variable 'LIVE_INSTALLATION'. 'LIVETEST' must not be set but only
#    'LIVECD'.
#
#    Verification run: http://lord.arch/tests/3043
