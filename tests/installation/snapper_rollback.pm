# *** TEST DESCRIPTION : ****
# test a rollback (as a backup) situation after system has migrated. (e.g from Sles12sp1 to sp2)
# we make snapper rollback and  go back to downgraded system, (1)
# and we make another rollback for return back to upgraded system. At the end we have 6 snapshots.
# we are in a read_only_snapshot 1 and after we are in a read_and_write (2)

# snapper rollback,  make 2 snapshots. From Manpage:
# Without a number, a first read-only snapshot of the default subvolume is created.:
# A second read-write snapshot of the current system is created.
# The system is set to boot from the second  snapshot.
