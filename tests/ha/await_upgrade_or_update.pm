    # This module is always intended to run right before `migration/version_switch_upgrade_target`
    # or `ha/cluster_state_mgmt`. The former would call `reset_consoles` on non pvm backends (spvm or
    # pvm_hmc) which would remove the console associated to the serial terminal without actually
    # closing the session in the terminal. As `ha/cluster_state_mgmt` calls
    # `serial_terminal::select_serial_terminal()` as its first step, if there is no active console
    # connected to the serial terminal, but there is an open session there, it can lead to
    # unexpected failures. As a workaround, we close the session in the serial terminal here and
    # reset the consoles in all nodes. This way, `select_serial_terminal()` will be able to re-activate
    # it and start a session when called later.
