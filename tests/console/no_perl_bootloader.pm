# G-Summary: Add test for fate#317701 - Do not use perl-bootloader in yast2-bootloader (#1571)
#    On SLE 12-SP2 or greater check that no perl-Bootloader-YAML is present in the
#    installed system as described as a test case in fate#317701.
#
#    Locally verified on TW where it fails because perl-Bootloader-YAML is present.
#
