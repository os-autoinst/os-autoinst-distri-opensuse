# Summary: Add openssh test cases for FIPS testing
#    Test Case 1525228: FIPS: openssh
#
#    Involve the existing openssh test case: sshd.pm
#
#    Create new case ssh_pubkey.pm to test public key
#
#    Create new case openssh_fips.pm to verify that
#    openssh will refuse to work with any non-approved
#    algorithm in fips mode, just like blowfish cipher
#    or MD5 hash.
# Maintainer: Qingming Su <qingming.su@suse.com>
