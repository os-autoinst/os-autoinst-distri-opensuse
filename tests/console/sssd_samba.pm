# Summary: Integration tests to sssd/samba (version conflicted libwbclient.so.0)
# Based on https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1162203
# The core issue was that samba has it's own version of libwbclient.so.0 but it
# is already present from winbind, which is not compatible with samba and causes
# the samba utilities to fail. So, we test to install winbind and then samba
# and check if smbclient is still working
#   * Install sssd winbind client
#   * Install (or force reinstall) samba
#   * Check if smbclient is still working
# Maintainer: Felix Niederwanger <felix.niederwanger@suse.de>
