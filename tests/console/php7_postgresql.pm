# Summary: PHP7 code that interacts locally with PostgreSQL
#   This tests creates a PostgreSQL database and inserts an element.
#   Then, PHP reads the elements and writes a new one in the database.
#   If all succeed, the test passes.
#
#   The test requires the Web and Scripting module on SLE
# Maintainer: Ondřej Súkup <osukup@suse.cz>
