# Summary: Verify hostname is setup according options selected in the installer.
# - Verify variable DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME is set to 'no'
# - Verify hostname is of the form linux-xxxx https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc/blob/master/linuxrc_hostname.md,
# which means that is not taken into account dhcp configuration provided for this test via NICTYPE_USER_OPTIONS=hostname=myguest
