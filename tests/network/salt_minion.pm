# Package: salt-minion sysstat procps
# Summary: Test Salt stack on two machines. This machine is running
#  salt-minion only and here we test the end result of master operations.
# - Install salt-minion
#   - Set hostname
#   - Enable debug
#   - Enable, start and check salt-minion service
# - Both machines are ready
# - Wait for the keys to be accepted
# - Check that the command executed from the master was successfully done
# - Check that the package installed from the master is present
# - Check that the user and it's group created from the master are present
# - Check that the sysctl value set from the master has right value
# - Stop the minion at the end
# Maintainer: Pavel Dostal <pdostal@suse.cz>
