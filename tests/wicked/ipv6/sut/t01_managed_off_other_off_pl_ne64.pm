# Summary: Managed off, other off, prefix length != 64
#   When radvd is set to managed off, other off, prefix length != 64
#   And I set up static IP addresses for eth0 from legacy files
#   And I let eth0 wait for a router announcement
#   And I retrigger DHCP requests
#   Then I should not obtain an address by DHCPv4
#   And I should not obtain an autonomous IPv6 address
#   And I should not obtain an address by DHCPv6
#   And no address should be tentative
#   And I should obtain a default IPv6 route
#   And I should not obtain a DNS server by DHCPv4
#   And I should not obtain a DNS server by DHCPv6
