# Package: yast2-country xdg-utils
# Summary: this test checks that YaST2's Keyboard module is behaving
#          correctly by changing keyboard layout and verifying that
#          they have been successfully set.
# - Start yast2 keyboard
# - Switch keymap from us to german
# - Use gedit to enter german characters to verify keyboard layout
# - Simulate german keystrokes to switch back us keymap
# - Expose and reproduce bsc#1142559 which was found during writing this script.
