# Summary: For openSUSE virtualization test only. login in console, install kvm/xen patterns if needed.
#  - Even if you'd like to run tests without host installation(IPMI_DO_NOT_RESTART_HOST=1), this module is still necessary as login console in this module is required.
#  - This module is added for openSUSE TW because of the difference beteen SLE and TW. Meanwile, login_console, install_package and update_package from SLE are not needed. The reasons are listed below:
#    -- login_console is not called after first boot in host installation in TW because kvm/xen patterns have not been installed at that time. reconnect_mgmt_console and first_boot take care of the login function.
#    -- have to zypper install kvm/xen patterns in TW.
#    -- no QA packages have been required any more.
#    -- no update is needed as it is Tumbleweed.
#    -- reboot is needed after kvm/xen patterns are installed so the module must run before reboot_and_wait_up_normal. login_console will still be called by reboot_and_wait_up_normal.
