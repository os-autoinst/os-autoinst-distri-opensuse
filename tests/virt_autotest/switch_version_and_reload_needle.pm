# Summary: This test changes the VERSION to TARGET_DEVELOPING_VERSION and reload needles.
#          This test should be loaded after host upgrade.
#          It needs to be wrapped in test because
#          set_var with reload_needles option needs to be run in test files rather than main.pm,
# Maintainer: xlai@suse.com
