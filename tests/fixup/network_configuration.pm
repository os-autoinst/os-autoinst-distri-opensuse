# G-Summary: Fixup network configuration when upgrading from openSUSE 13.2 (and lower)
#    openSUSE 13.2's (and earlier) systemd has broken rules for virtio-net,
#    not applying predictable names (despite being configured). A maintenance
#    update breaking networking names sounds worse than just accepting
#    that 13.2 -> TW breaks with virtio-net.
#
#    Since consoletest_setup is no longer the first thing running after the
#    system has been updated (it is now the check for applicable updates) this
#    fixup needed to be moved out of consoletest_setup in order to be started
#    earlier (again, asap, before nything wants to access the network)
# G-Maintainer: Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>
