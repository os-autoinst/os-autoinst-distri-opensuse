# Summary: FIPS: openssh
#    Involve the existing openssh test case: sshd.pm
#
#    Create new case ssh_pubkey.pm to test public key
#
#    Create new case openssh_fips.pm to verify that
#    openssh will refuse to work with any non-approved
#    algorithm in fips mode, just like blowfish cipher
#    or MD5 hash.
