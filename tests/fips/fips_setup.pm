# G-Summary: Setup system work into fips mode
#    Install fips pattern and update grub.cfg with fips=1
#
#    Also include workaround of bsc#982268:
#    Due to bsc#982268, openssl couldn't enter fips mode even the
#    system is booted with fips=1. Workaround is create the file
#    /etc/system-fips manually.
