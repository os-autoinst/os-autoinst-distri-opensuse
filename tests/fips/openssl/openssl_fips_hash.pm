# Test description: In fips mode, openssl only works with the FIPS
# approved HASH algorithms: SHA1 and SHA2 (224, 256, 384, 512)

# G-Summary: Add Hash and Cipher test cases for openssl-fips
#    A new test suite is created for FIPS_TS, named "core", which will
#    contain all the basic test cases for fips verificaton. Just like
#    the cases to verify opessl hash, cipher, or public key algorithms
