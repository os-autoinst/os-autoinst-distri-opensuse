# Test description: In fips mode, openssl only works with the FIPS
# approved HASH algorithms: SHA1 and SHA2 (224, 256, 384, 512)
#
# Summary: Add Hash and Cipher test cases for openssl-fips
#          A new test suite "core" is created, which contains all the basic
#          test cases for fips verificaton when FIPS_ENABLED is set, like
#          the cases to verify opessl hash, cipher, or public key algorithms
