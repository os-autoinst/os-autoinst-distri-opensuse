=head1 NAME

ipaddr2/test_move_resource - Test IPaddr2 resource migration in a cluster

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This test verifies the functionality of moving an IPaddr2 cluster resource
between two virtual machines in a high-availability setup. It uses `crm`
commands to move the resource and then checks if the web service is correctly
served from the new master node. The test performs the move in both directions
(VM1 to VM2 and VM2 to VM1) and includes sanity checks for OS connectivity and
cluster status.

=head1 SETTINGS

=over

=item B<PUBLIC_CLOUD_PROVIDER>

Specifies the public cloud provider. This module currently only supports 'AZURE'.

=item B<IPADDR2_DIAGNOSTIC>

If set to 1, deployment logs are collected in case of a test failure.

=item B<IPADDR2_CLOUDINIT>

If not set to 0, cloud-init logs are collected in case of a test failure.

=item B<IBSM_RG>

The name of the resource group for the IBSM (Infrastructure Backup and Support
Module), used for cleaning up network peerings.
