=head1 NAME

hana_sr_schedule_cleanup.pm - Schedules the cleanup test module.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module schedules the 'sles4sap/publiccloud/qesap_cleanup' test module to be executed at the end of the test queue.
This is necessary to ensure that resource cleanup is the very last action performed, especially when other test modules
also use 'loadtest' to schedule tests.

=head1 SETTINGS

This module does not have any specific settings. It passes the test run arguments to the scheduled cleanup module.
