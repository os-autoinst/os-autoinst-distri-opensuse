# Summary: Test module for performing database stop using various methods on secondary HANA database site.

=head1 NAME

hana_sr_test_secondary.pm - Tests the secondary (replica) HANA database node.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module tests the resilience and recovery of the secondary (replica) HANA
database node in a System Replication setup. It simulates a failure on the
secondary node by performing an action such as 'stop', 'kill', or 'crash'.

After the action is performed, the module waits for the node to recover and
verifies that the HANA database starts correctly and that the node remains in
replication (secondary) mode without being promoted to primary. It also checks
the overall cluster health after the event.

This module is typically scheduled by C<hana_sr_schedule_replica_tests.pm>, which
passes the specific action to perform via the C<$run_args> hashref.

=head1 SETTINGS

=over

=item B<DB_ACTION>

Specifies the action to be performed on the secondary HANA database. Valid options
are 'stop', 'kill', or 'crash'. This variable can be used to run the test standalone,
but it is typically overridden by the parameters passed from the scheduling module.
