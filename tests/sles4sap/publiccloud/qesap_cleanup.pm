=head1 NAME

qesap_cleanup.pm - Cleans up the cloud resources.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is responsible for cleaning up the cloud resources that were deployed
for the test run. It is typically scheduled as the last test in a sequence to
ensure that all resources are properly removed. The cleanup process can be
skipped by setting the B<QESAP_NO_CLEANUP> variable.

=head1 SETTINGS

=over

=item B<QESAP_NO_CLEANUP>

If this variable is set to a true value, the cleanup process will be skipped.
This is useful for debugging or when the deployed infrastructure needs to be
inspected after the test run.
