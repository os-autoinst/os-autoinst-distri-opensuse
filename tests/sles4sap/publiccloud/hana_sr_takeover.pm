# Summary: Test module for performing database takeover using various methods on "master" HANA database.

=head1 NAME

hana_sr_takeover.pm - Performs a HANA database takeover.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module tests the takeover process in a SAP HANA System Replication environment.
It simulates a failure on the primary (master) HANA database node using a specified
action (e.g., 'stop', 'kill', 'crash'). After the failure is induced, the module
verifies that the cluster correctly promotes the secondary node to become the new
primary. It then checks the cluster status, ensures replication is re-established,
and cleans up resources to return the cluster to a stable state.

This module is typically scheduled by another test module (e.g., C<hana_sr_schedule_primary_tests.pm>)
and receives its parameters through the C<$run_args> hashref. The C<action> and C<site_name>
parameters, which define the test's behavior, are passed within the C<$run_args->{hana_test_definitions}{$test_name}> hashref.

=head1 SETTINGS

=over

=item B<PUBLIC_CLOUD_PROVIDER>

If set to 'EC2' and the takeover action is 'stop', a specific SBD (STONITH Block Device)
delay is configured to prevent timing issues during the test.
